Project building a responsive clone of the medium website from scratch

Technologies used-

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

Personal Notes-

1) The motivation behind this project was to look to improve my vanilla CSS skills. Cloning a relatively tricky design and having it be responsive without the help of external frameworks felt like good opportunity to do so.
2) This project was helpful in manipulating elements positioning and sizing to mimic how those same elements were positioned in the website I was creating a replica of.
3) This project also improved my ability to think logically and strategically in how I went about rebuilding the page.
