Responsive Medium Clone

Project building a responsive clone of the medium website

Technologies used-

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

Personal Notes-

1) I was looking to improve my vanilla CSS skills and cloning a relatively tricky design and having it be responsive without the help of external frameworks felt like 
good opportunity to improve my skills in this department.
2) This project was helpful in manipulating elements positioning and sizing to mimic how those same elements were positioned in the website I was creating a copy of.
3) Also it improved my ability to think logically and strategically in how I went about rebuilding the page.
